# RSA Encryption Project

This project demonstrates a simplified implementation of the **RSA encryption algorithm** using Python. The goal is to understand and apply RSA encryption with smaller prime numbers for learning purposes. This includes key generation, message encryption, and decryption processes.

## Project Structure
- **`Primzahlen.py`**: Contains a list of small prime numbers for key generation.
- **`RSA_Encryption.py`**: Implements the RSA encryption algorithm, including key generation, encryption, and decryption functionalities.
- **`RSA_Encryption_Assignment.pdf`**: A detailed explanation and documentation about the RSA algorithm and its mathematical background.

## Features
- **Prime Number List**: Uses a predefined list of small prime numbers from `Primzahlen.py` to simulate the RSA encryption process.
- **Key Generation**: Randomly selects two distinct primes for public and private key generation.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Allows the user to encrypt and decrypt messages using the generated keys.
- **User Interaction**: Prompts the user for input on whether to encrypt or decrypt a message and whether they want to manually choose RSA parameters.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
